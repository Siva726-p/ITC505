        <h1>Blockchain Technology: Revolutionizing Data Security and Transactions</h1>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Blockchain provides a decentralized and secure approach to transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries. 
        This paper explores its applications beyond cryptocurrencies, including supply chain management, healthcare, finance, and identity verification.</p>

        <h2>Keywords</h2>
        <p>Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Smart Contracts, Decentralization, Security, Consensus Mechanism, Distributed Ledger</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Originally introduced for Bitcoin, blockchain technology has expanded into various industries due to its ability to provide transparency, security, and efficiency. 
        By leveraging a decentralized ledger, blockchain ensures data integrity and mitigates fraud risks. Industries such as banking, logistics, and government services 
        are actively integrating blockchain solutions.</p>

        <h2>How Blockchain Works</h2>
        <p>Blockchain operates through a distributed ledger system where transactions are recorded in blocks and linked chronologically. 
        These blocks are secured using cryptographic hashes, and a consensus mechanism, such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), ensures network validity. 
        This decentralized nature removes reliance on central authorities and reduces transaction costs.</p>

        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Supply Chain Management:</strong> Blockchain enhances transparency in supply chains by providing an immutable record of product movements, ensuring authenticity and traceability.</li>
            <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Medical records stored on a blockchain enhance security, reduce fraud, and provide seamless access across healthcare providers.</li>
            <li><strong>Finance and Banking:</strong> Blockchain facilitates faster and more secure cross-border payments, reduces banking fraud, and enables decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Smart Contracts:</strong> Self-executing contracts coded on a blockchain eliminate the need for intermediaries, reducing transaction costs and enhancing efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Identity Verification:</strong> Blockchain-based digital identities provide enhanced security, reducing identity theft and ensuring secure online transactions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Despite its advantages, blockchain faces several challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The increasing transaction load requires efficient solutions like Layer 2 scaling techniques (e.g., Lightning Network).</li>
            <li><strong>Energy Consumption:</strong> Proof of Work-based blockchains consume significant energy, prompting research into greener alternatives like Proof of Stake.</li>
            <li><strong>Regulatory Uncertainty:</strong> Governments worldwide are still formulating regulatory frameworks, which impact blockchain adoption and integration.</li>
            <li><strong>Adoption Barriers:</strong> Enterprises face challenges in integrating blockchain with existing legacy systems, requiring robust interoperability solutions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Future of Blockchain</h2>
        <p>Blockchain is poised to transform industries by driving greater security and efficiency. Innovations such as quantum-resistant blockchains, 
        hybrid blockchain models, and improved consensus algorithms will shape the next evolution of this technology. As governments and enterprises embrace blockchain, 
        we can expect enhanced interoperability, wider adoption in financial services, and integration with emerging technologies like AI and IoT.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Blockchain has the potential to disrupt industries by improving security, transparency, and efficiency. 
        Addressing its challenges will be key to its widespread adoption. With continuous innovation, blockchain is set to redefine data security and transaction processing globally.</p>

        <h1>Design Addendum</h1>

        <h2>Font Choices</h2>
        <p>I selected <strong>Arial</strong> as the primary font because it is modern, sans-serif, and easy to read. 
        This choice enhances clarity and provides a professional look that is effective for a text-heavy webpage.</p>

        <h2>Heading and Text Sizes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>h1:</strong> 28px - The largest heading, used for the main title.</li>
            <li><strong>h2:</strong> 24px - Section headings are large enough to stand out but not overpower the title.</li>
            <li><strong>Body text:</strong> 16px - A comfortable reading size for paragraphs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Color Choices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Background color:</strong> Beige (#F5F5DC) - A neutral tone that is easy on the eyes.</li>
            <li><strong>Text color:</strong> Dark gray (#333) - Provides high contrast without being too harsh.</li>
            <li><strong>Headings:</strong> Dark blue-gray (#2C3E50) - Helps differentiate headings from body text.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Margin and Padding Choices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Body padding:</strong> 20px - Ensures text does not touch the edges of the screen.</li>
            <li><strong>Article padding:</strong> 20px - Creates spacing within the content area for a balanced layout.</li>
            <li><strong>Headings:</strong> Margins add space between sections for readability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>HTML Structure Corrections</h2>
        <p>Initially, I used an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tag for the title because it looked better. However, since the title of the essay 
        is the most important heading, I corrected this by using an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag, ensuring proper document semantics.</p>
